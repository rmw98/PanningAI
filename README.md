**Status:** In Development



## About The Project

AI Shopping Watchdog is a Chrome browser extension designed to be an intelligent shopping assistant for users on Amazon. 

When activated on a product page, the extension scrapes all relevant data (specifications, price, reviews, etc.) and uses an AI model to perform a deep, unbiased analysis. The goal is to save users time and help them avoid bad purchases by identifying potential red flags that casual shoppers might miss.

### Core Features
*   **On-Page Analysis:** Get a detailed product evaluation without ever leaving the Amazon page.
*   **The "Watchdog Score":** A clear, data-driven score from 1-100 that summarizes the product's overall quality and value.
*   **Pros & Cons Summary:** A concise, easy-to-read list of the most important positive and negative points, synthesized from all available data.
*   **Red Flag Detection:** Identifies issues like misleading reviews, outdated technology, poor value for money, and more.

## Development & Technology

This repository tracks the development of the AI Shopping Watchdog extension. The core technology stack includes:
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the extension popup)
*   **Core Logic:** JavaScript (for the background service worker and content scripts)
*   **AI/LLM Integration:** The analysis is powered by a sophisticated prompt-engineered Large Language Model.

## Project Status & Availability

The extension is currently under active development. The initial prototype and core data-scraping functionalities are complete. The next phases involve integrating a live AI model and preparing for a public release on the Chrome Web Store.

**This project is being developed to be submitted to the Amazon Associates Program.** The extension will be monetized through affiliate links, allowing us to offer the service for free to users.
